		<h1>Mazda 3</h1>

		<p>The Mazda company was founded in Japan in 1920 by Jujiro Matsuda and was a cork manufacturer and it was called Toyo Kogyo, not Mazda.  In 1931, the company launched the “Mazda-go” which was a tricycle truck and it was their first vehicle.</p>

		<p>The first generation Mazda 3 was released in 2004.  The newest generation is the 3rd generation released in 2013.  You can buy a 6 speed manual or automatic transmission car.  It has a 2 liter engine.  It gets around 7.5L/100km average combined city and highway gas mileage.</p>

		<p>A good thing about the Mazda 3 is that it is fun to drive, all of the reviews say that one of the best things about it is that it feels very good to drive.  Another very nice thing about the car is that it is good on gas.  Also, the car comes in a hatchback model so that is a good thing.</p>

		<p>One of the bad things about the Mazda 3 is the noisy interior.  Also the paint on the car is very thin and can chip easily.  Mazda has known to rust quickly if not taken care of.</p>

		<p>The Mazda 3 would be a good car for students because it is not too big and has good gas mileage.  Also, the older models should be affordable for students.</p>
