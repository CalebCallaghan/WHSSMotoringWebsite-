		<h1>Registering A Boat</h1>

		<h2>How Do You Register Or License A Boat?</h2>

		<p>In order to register or license a boat to drive on the water you must go to Transport Canada and give them your information. Registering a boat will require a small fee, as well as they need all the information about your boat. Including the name of the vessel and port registration. However, you only need to register if you plan on using your boat for more commercial services. Licensing doesn't cost anything, but is simply for using your boat for recreational use. You can also temporarily register any vessel that's under construction in Canada.</p>

		<h2>Can You Renew Your Registration?</h2>

		<p>You can always renew your registration once it becomes close to its original expiry date. You should however get it before it gets too close to expiring. If you don't have this certificate you can't drive your boat in Canada as you must always have a valid copy on board your vessel. Usually they send it to you 30 days before your previous certificate expires. If it doesn't come in before two weeks before the expiration your recommended to email them, or call to make sure your certificate is on its way.</p>

		<h2>Can You Trade Ownership/Registration To Someone Else?</h2>

		<p>Yes, you can for sure trade in the ownership to someone else for a fee of 150 dollars, but the expiry date doesn't change for the new person. However for a larger vessel it will cost at least 250 dollars to change it to somebody else's name.  In order to trade ownership you have to have the bill of sale, a statement of qualification, and an appointment of authorized representative. If you don't have a marine bill of sale you have to complete a statutory declaration before a Justice of the Peace, Commissioner for Oaths, or any other person by law administer oaths.</p>
