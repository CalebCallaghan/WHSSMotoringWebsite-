		<h1>Uprading Your Boat</h1>

		<h2>Maintenance</h2>

		<p>Keeping up with your boats maintenance is the first step to being able to upgrade to better things. Especially since if it’s in bad condition, it might not run, or it might not be worth the money you would have to invest. Maintenance would include cleaning the carpets/floor of the boat, any glass/windshield, the hull, interior rooms, and anything that's exposed to water. Cleaning isn’t the only thing that needs to be done. Changing batteries for things like CO2 detectors or a light is just as important. Overall maintenance is probably the most important thing to do when you own a boat. It also determines future values if you plan to sell it.</p>

		<h2>Upgrading Current Vessel</h2>

		<p>Upgrading your boat adds value and comfort for you and any guests you might happen to be travelling with. The first upgrade for a boat would be a new or better motor. It's probably one of the most important parts of a boat as it allows it to move. Upgrading or replacing it with a new one easily ups the price when you go to sell. Snap-in carpeting is another upgrade that boaters like as it's comfortable to walk on with your feet, and it also adds to the design of the boat. On board lighting and stereo systems are popular upgrades as well. They add both a design and comfort to your boating experience.</p>

		<h2>Upgrading To A Bigger Vessel</h2>

		<p>Upgrading your boat to a bigger size has its ups and downs. The easiest one is that the motor size has to increase in order to move the larger mass in the water. So while you can technically reach a higher top speed(Depending on the boat.) you’ll be paying more for gas. Larger boats can easily carry more people, as well as providing more storage space for guests or the owners. Comfort and safety are very important when you’re out on the water. Having a bigger boat provides both for you and guests. As the boats get larger in size the larger there width is, as well as the length. However its width that really determines the stability in this case. Though if the boat is to wide it won’t move through the water as well. So overall though it comes down to buying price and whether or not you can afford an upgrade or not. </p>
