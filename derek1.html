		<h1>Proper Gear</h1>

		<h2>First A Helmet</h2>

		<p>The helmet is for the protection of your face and head. For example if you fall off your bike and hit your head off the ground that helmet will protect you from getting any real big injuries if you didn't have a helmet on depending on what you would be riding you could get seriously hurt, you could have a major concussion or split your head open or if you were riding with another person and they didn't see you fall they could hit you by accident with their bike. If you had your helmet on the damage wouldn't be minimal or maybe there wouldn't be any damage to your head. Your helmet should be snug to your face and should be tightened as much as possible with the chin strap to make sure it stays on your head.</p>

		<h2>Second Boots</h2>

		<p>The boots are the extra protection to your shins. The boots are also used for shifting properly the boots make it easy to shift. Another thing is if you are turning you put your foot out so you don't fall if you hit something hard with a normal shoe that would hurt but if you have boots they have metal like plates on the front of the boots so it wouldn't hurt as much to hit it. These boots are also designed to go off road and protect your shins from getting hit with things like rocks.  </p>

		<h2>Third Gloves </h2>

		<p>The gloves are for your hands protection. If you fall off they protect your hands from getting scratched and their are small pads for your knuckles that help with your grip in the throttle and the other handle. Gloves are also useful for when it's a little cold outside and you need something to keep your hands warm.</p>

		<h2>Forth Is Elbow Guards Roost Protector And Knee Guards </h2>

		<p>The elbow guards and knee guards are pretty standard they are used for protection if you fall off your bike. You wont get as scratched up as you would if you were wearing them. Now the roost protector that is like a shield  that goes on your chest and back and on your shoulders. This is for if someone is in front of you and they shoot rocks and dirt at you. If you didn't have the roost protector on and you got rocks shooting at you it would really hurt.  </p>
