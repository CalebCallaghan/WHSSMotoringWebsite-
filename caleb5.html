		<h1>License For Seadoos</h1>

		<h2>How Do I Get A License For PWC’s?</h2>

		<p>Getting your license for a seadoo is the same as getting a basic pleasure craft operator card. As long as you pass the test in class or online you can obtain one of these. There not difficult to obtain and come in handy every once in awhile. For teenagers without a driver’s license or anything else this can be an easy way to get some driving experience even if it isn’t quite the same. As well once you have the license it never goes away unless the laws are changed, or you lose it for legal reasons.</p>

		<h2>Are There Any Restrictions For Driving A PWC?
    </h2>

		<p>There is an age restriction for driving seadoos. You must be at least 16 years or older and have obtained a boating license. As well as you must still respect all the rules on the water even while driving a PWC or seadoo. A PWC is still considered a watercraft and therefore must be driven appropriately. Meaning that speed restrictions still apply as well as any no wake signs in the area. PWC’s have to go through their own safetying before being put on the water however its usually done before their bought.
    </p>

		<h2>Are There Any Passenger Limits Or Weight Limits?</h2>

		<p>All PWC’s have their own weight as well as passenger limits and they should be respected. Going over these could damage the seadoo or hurt somebody on the watercraft. Most people suggest that a two person seadoo really only fits one large adult. So be careful when you buy and make sure you can defeinetely fit two people.
As well three seaters are usually only able to fit about two full size adults and a small child. So be sure to check this before purchasing one. As well weight limits shouldn’t be passed so if the weight limit is 400, and the seadoo is a two seater than both passengers must be under 200 to fit.
