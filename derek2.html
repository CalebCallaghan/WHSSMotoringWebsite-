		<h1>How to change motorcycle/motocross tires</h1>

		<p>First you will need three to four tire irons, you might want to get a rim sleeve to protect the rim from scratches. If you can get a motocross/motorcycle tire stand that would be very helpful. First you have to deflate your tire. After it has been deflated you want to break the bead. Some bikes have a bead lock which should be on the opposite side of the air steam. Loosen this off if you have one before breaking the bead. For use on the tire machine lock tire to machine and put on tire iron in and pull the tire above the rim. Careful not to damage the rim. Then put the second tire iron in leave the first one in the same place. Then start to lift as well after you get one side out carefully pull tube out if you do have a tube, have a spare tube just in case for each rim. After getting the tube out check for leaks. That can be done with soapy water or you might be able to see it. Remember to have the tube slightly filled with air. After checking tube for leaks get the old tire the rest of the way off... When putting the next tire on put in only half way on then insert the tube in the correct spot. After doing that then take the tire irons out and fold the tire over the rim back into the normal spot. If the tire doesn't want to go onto the rim use some soapy water to help. After it is on make sure all spokes are still there and tight after that is all done fill the tube and check that it is seated properly. If it needs a lot of presser careful not to pop the tube but remember to bring it back down to about 12.5 psi to 14 psi. After that is all done tighten bead lock and reinstall to bike.</p>
