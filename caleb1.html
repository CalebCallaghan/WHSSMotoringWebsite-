<h1>License For Boats </h1>

	<h2>What Is The Law In Canada For Getting A License?</h2>

	<p>Up until the year 1999 anyone in Canada could operate a boat without having an actual license. However due to a spike in watercraft related injuries and deaths, the government decided to have everyone take an exam to get their license.
	You can get your license by taking a class or online. It takes a few hours to do depending on how familiar you are with boating. Anyone using their boat to hunt or in Nunavut or North West Territories will have different rules regarding licensing. Rental boats have different rules that apply as you only have to take a temporary test to ensure that you know what you’re doing. As well the license, or PCOC, cannot be on a sheet of paper or stored electronically.</p>

	<h2>What Will This Course Teach You?</h2>

	<p>This course will provide you with knowledge about the basic principles of boating as well as safety measures you should take while out in the water. It will teach you how to share the waterways with smaller watercrafts or larger commercial ships. It will also help you navigate all the equipment you’ll need while boating as well as any medical supplies you should keep on board. Similar to driving a car, boaters use certain signals to tell everyone what there doing as well as the rules implace for boats coming in another direction.</p>

	<h2>What Are The Age Limits And Restrictions?</h2>

	<p>Anyone 12 or older can go get their personal boating license at anytime, however the restrictions in place are different. Youth at the age of 12 may only operate a boat with a motor of 10hp/7.5 kW without supervision. Anyone between 12-15 can operate a boat with 40hp/30 kW without supervision. Anyone of the age 16 has no restrictions so long as long as it’s a pleasure craft.</p>

	<h2>Are There Different Types Of Boating Licenses?</h2>

	<p>This is just your base pleasure craft license(Or PCOC) there are many more you can get that will allow you to drive all different sorts of watercrafts. For smaller crafts all you need is a small vessel operator proficiency(Or SVOP). As well as you have to get a license for all commercial vehicles. These licenses come in different classes and as you progress you can eventually get your captain's license. As well all of these types of licenses are for different types of boats and the rules are all different for each.</p>
