		<h1>Aston Martin DB11</h1>

		<p>Aston Martin was founded by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford in 1913 in a tiny London workshop.  They had a passion for creating beautiful race cars for people to enjoy.  Aston Martin was named after a race that took place on Aston Clinton Hill where they won.  The first named Aston Martin model was the "standard sports model"  that was released in 1921.</p>

		<p>The DB11 model was a grand tourer first released in 2016 and it was designed by Marek Reichman.  It debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2016.  One of the models has a 600 horsepower 5.2 litre twin turbocharged V12.  The reviews for the car have been very positive and it won the Golden Steering Wheel Award from Axel Springer.</p>

		<p>One of the good things about this car is that it is very beautiful.  Another would be that the performance of this car is very good and the interior is luxurious and comfortable.  The car can go from 0 to 60 mph in about 4 seconds.</p>

		<p>A bad thing about the car is that there is no manual transmission model you can buy.  Also, the rear seats are very small. As well as the vehicle is a luxury and is very expensive and not for everyone.</p>

		<p>I do not recommend this car to students because it is very expensive to buy and service, because it is a luxury sports car and not many are on the roads.  Another reason I do not recommend it is that the gas mileage is very bad so you will spend lots of money on gas and parts.</p>
