	<h1>Fixing a yamaha bike</h1>
	<p>Derek has had this bike for over 1 year. It has been in a couple falls but nothing serious that can't be fixed.  During this video we will be doing a teardown which involves taking everything apart… from plastics to the motor. </p>
	<p>You always want to make sure you know what your taking apart and you have to know how to put it back together. You always want to use the right tools to ensure you don't strip your bolts or nuts… proper screw drivers so you don't strip you screws. </p>
	<p>Always be sure your bike is steady on you stand or whatever your bike is sitting on to ensure your bike doesn't fall off and get damaged. </p>
	<p>A little bit of history about yamaha is they were the first to implement reed valves, single-shock suspension and power valves all started with the Yamaha. Yamaha had their 2 strokes dialed in from the beginning, they also had the best technology, frames, motors and suspension. Yamaha dirt bikes are one of the most desired bikes on the market for racing and trail riding to this day. Yamaha first started making dirt bikes in 1955 but didn't actually start calling them dirt bikes until 1968.</p>
	<p>The tool that you would need to take apart a yamaha yz250 2 stroke would be</p>
	<li>Ratchets </li>
	<li>Wrenches</li>
	<li>Allen keys </li>
	<li>Philips and flathead screwdrivers </li>
	<li>Balancing stand </li>
	<li>Spoke wrenches</li>
	<li>12 102453.62 </li>
	<li>Organization tray</li>
	<p>After everything is taken apart you will want to clean everything (hand cleaning) the frame as much as the motor as possible (tooth brush) swing arm, forks and subframe. Then you have to clean and re oil/ grease all barrings. Have to check for leaks in forks. If forks are leaking have to wrap them in a towel and possibly bring into a shop to find out where the leak is located, if leak is coming from seals we will just have to replace the seals.</p>
