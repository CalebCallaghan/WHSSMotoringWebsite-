		<h1>White Water Kayaking </h1>

		<h2>What Is White Water Kayaking?</h2>

		<p>White water kayaking is the extreme side to this sport. It combines fast rivers and rocks with a good amount of adrenaline. This sport up until the 20th century was very dangerous and therefore not that popular. Only more recently after having better equipment and kayak's did it become a new extreme sport. Although Eskimos had invented originally for travelling through difficult rivers and waterways. As of today is one of our more dangerous water sports. Although it's recommended that you know how to use a regular kayak on calm water first.</p>

		<h2>How Does This Sport Work?</h2>

		<p>White water kayaking works like this, you have a bunch of checkpoints that you have to clear while going down a river as fast as you can. Once you complete all these checkpoints they record your time for each one. Comparing these to your competitors they can see who ran the race faster. As well as wich checkpoints your time needs to improve. Therefore allowing you to take that data away from the race and improve yourself. As well all racers have to wear proper safety equipment at all times during the race. As well, even some professionals can lose control so stay in your skill level and no where you should and shouldn’t go.</p>

		<h2>What Kayak To You Buy?</h2>

		<p>White water kayaks are more expensive and are a different fit for everyone. So that means just because you heard your friend got one and liked it doesn’t mean it’ll suit your needs at all. First off there are 3 types of kayaks you have to consider playboats, river runners, and creekboats. Each is made specifically for different situations. River Runners are made for the pure use of white water kayaking as they tend to be the toughest and fastest. Playboats are slower and are more for general use or beginners. Creekboats are usually used for vertical drops and navigating. Each has its speciality as well as differences. However for the purpose of white water kayaking a river runner would work perfectly. As well, some kayaks are in two categories often creek boats and river boats are made into one. This is because sometimes there are vertical drops on the white water rivers.</p>
