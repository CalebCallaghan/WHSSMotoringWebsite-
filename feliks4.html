		<h1>Aston Martin V12 Vantage</h1>

		<p>Aston Martin was founded by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford in 1913 in a tiny London workshop.  They had a passion for creating beautiful race cars for people to enjoy all around Europe.  Aston Martin was named after a race that took place on Aston Clinton Hill where they won.  The first named Aston Martin model was the “standard sports model”  that was released in 1921.</p>

		<p>In December 2007, a concept car based on the V8 Vantage was shown.  The Aston Martin V12 Vantage was released in 2009.  It has a 5.9 litre V12 engine and can go from 0 to 60 in 3.8 seconds.  Transmission options include a 7 speed manual transmission or a 7 speed sport shift III.</p>

		<p>One of the good things about this car is that it is fast and can do 0 to 60 in 3.8 seconds.  Another thing about the Vantage is that you can get the vehicle with a manual transmission installed.  It also has a top speed of 205mph or 329km/s.</p>

		<p>Some people have said that the sportshift transmission is not that good, so that is one bad thing about the car.  Also, because the car is so exclusive that not many people have tested it means that the car can have some obscure glitches and problems.</p>

		<p>As a car for students, this is not really a good choice.  First of all, it is very expensive so most students will have a hard time affording it.  Also, it is not really meant for daily use since it is an expensive luxury car. Therefore more km/s affect its resale price.  Also, you will spend lots of money on gas for it since the average gas mileage is 14 mpg.</p>
