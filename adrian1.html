	<h1>The first time I rode a dirt bike</h1>

<h2>My experiences </h2>
 <p>It's amazing riding a dirt bike. You get the rush of adrenaline and you feel the wind on your body and you can see everything around you just passing by. It is a great way to start your summer. When you first pull out your bike and make sure it's ready to ride, you check it over to see if anything needs to be fixed, you make sure your gas tank is full and you check everything else. If everything is good to go you feel that rush, the rush before you even get to ride. The rush that you get through your body when you realize that you get to ride, that rush is one of the greatest feelings in the world. </p>
<p>When I first rode last year I fell and I didn't fall off to the point where I was on the ground I fell into a hydro pole after a tree branch hit me in the face,  the tree branch hit my helmet and it caught me off guard and then I fell over. And of course my boyfriend was recording me and he couldn't stop laughing at me. This year I will be riding some more. I haven't ridden since last summer so I guarantee Iâ€™m going to stall it a whole bunch of times before I actually get to ride it but I think I will eventually get it going.</p>
 <p>Some information about this bike that is important is this dirt bike is way to big for me. The bike I am going to ride is a yz250 2 stroke. The bike I should be riding is a yz80 2 stroke or yz85 2 stroke because it is smaller and I would fit on it better. According to Yamaha Motors a yz85 2 stroke seat to floor is 2.758333333 feet, I wouldn't have to have someone hold up the bike so I don't fall off and so I can actually kick start it.</p>
