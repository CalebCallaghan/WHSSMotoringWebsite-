	<h1>Choosing the right tire type for a dirt bike </h1>

	<p>Choosing the right tire for your dirt bike, the first thing you will want to do is choose the brand you want. The brand I will be choosing will be Dunlop tires, I'm going to compare a couple different types of tires...</p>
	<p>First we have a soft to intermediate tires, these tires are used for extremely soft ground -- not ground that is packed down. These tires are usually use for wet tracks and wet trails, but not if the trail or track is super muddy (No more than 6 inches of mud). These tires usually aren't  used on packed down ground or pavement, these tires wouldn't last very long if you were to ride on anything like hard ground. They have the most traction but these tires will wear down a lot faster than hard tires.</p>
	<p>The second tire we are going to look at is an intermediate to hard tire, these tires are tires that can ride hard packed trails or tracks. These tires are usually used for motocross meaning they are meant for racing or going fast on packed dirt. These tires will last longer than the soft tires and they don't have as much traction on soft ground or hard ground. </p>
	<p>The third tire we will be looking at is the sand/mud terrain these tires are usually used for sand and mud as the tire name tells you that. These tires can be used for soft and hard ground but these tires wouldn't get very much traction on soft and hard ground, they are meant for sand and mud that's the only thing these tires would get traction on. These tires would last longer than a soft tire if they were used on soft or hard trails and tracks meaning they could go on to a soft or hard track, but they are recommended for only sand and mud thats where they would last the longest. </p>
