	<h1>First experience doing wheelies ( off road)</h1>

	<p>I wanted to learn how to do wheelies for getting over fallen trees or objects on a trail or when riding around. When I first did a small wheelie it was scary at first you feel like youâ€™re going to  fall over and crash your bike. When you get used to it, you will end up going further and further back. You will most likely fall, I did. But once you fall, you have to get right back on and do a small one again. </p>
	<p>Make sure you have checked your bike over before getting back on, no fuel leaks, bars are straight and forks aren't out of line. After checking it over you should be able to get right back on and ride if you haven't broken any thing. The more you practice in an open field, the better.  After you get comfortable, then you can start putting objects in front of the bike to hop up on and over start with small things and work your way up, the better you are the safer it is for trail riding. Once you get the wheelies over logs practice tanking up on the bike while it isn't moving without your feet touching the ground, the reason for this is after you jump over a log with a wheelie there could be another log right after or rocks that you definitely do not want to fall over on. The better you get the safer it is!</p>
	<p>Always wear proper gear while doing tricks like this, gear needed ,Helmet, gloves, knee pads and elbow pads, last boots, a good pair of motocross boots will save your ankles from breaking when falling over, good gear and good riding will insure maximum safety and enjoyable ride without being scared that you will get hurt.</p>
