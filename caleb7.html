		<h1>New V.S. Old Seadoos</h1>

		<h2>Benefits Of Both</h2>

		<p>Jet skis as there commonly called or seadoos are often very different depending on year, make, and size. The newer models are often bigger and can fit more passengers. Speed depends again on the make and what not. The newer model are more commonly 4 stroke. The newer ones handle a lot better than the older requiring you to use less on the gas and being more precise around corners. Older model require a lot more gas and arenâ€™t as controlled when turning. Older models tend to be 2 stroke rather than the 4 stroke. This is because 2 strkes are faster however not as efficient. They use a lot more fuel and cause more pollution. So if speed is your thing then you might want to go with a 2 stroke, but if your just using it as a nice family toy a 4 stroke is better suited.</p>

		<h2>Why You Buy A Newer Model?
</h2>

		<p>If your trying to be more green the newer models are the way to go. 4 strokes produce less carbon emissions and thus hurt the environment less. They can go out for longer rides as the mileage is far better. This means less money spent on gas and more time to have fun. They are slower as the 4 stroke generates less torque. Overall there more family friendly and are way safer. So for young adults or older teenagers driving one for their first time the newer models are perfect.</p>

		<h2>Why Would You Buy An Older Model?
</h2>

		<p>2 strokes are a lot faster as they produce twice as much torque compared to a 4 stroke.
More power on seadoo means more fun and more air time. Although 2 strokes are a little more difficult to drive compared to a 4 stroke. Recommending you have some experience before doing anything to out of sorts. 2 strokes are also cheaper as well as its easier and cheaper to fix them. Aside from that the older models are known to be more reliable as there's less electronics.
