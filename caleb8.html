		<h1>Kayaking</h1>

		<h2>The Basics</h2>

		<p>Kayaking isn’t very dangerous and is meant to be relaxing. Paddling over a lake or pond should be nice and easy. Though there are still some basic rules that everyone should know. First off if you're new to kayaking then starting on a small lake or pond with no wake or powerboats would be ideal. Learning how to control a kayak by just simply paddling is key. Once you're comfortable you have the basics down. As well having a buddy is important. Someone who can call for help or provide assistance just in case something happens.</p>

		<h2>Gear
</h2>

		<p>Kayak’s aren’t exactly cheap and can be quite pricey for a nice one. As well as you can always rent one. Other items like life jackets have to be certified and safetied to be sure that you’ll float not sink. As well as life jackets have sizes and to wear they appropriate size so it doesn’t slip off. For warmer weather a t-shirt and shorts would be fine, but for colder temperatures a body suit might be needed. Paddles aren’t too expensive depending on where you get one. First aid supplies should always be kept on the kayak at all times just in case it's needed. Put it in a plastic bag just in case the boat capsizes.
As well it's good to wear water shoes as if you fall out you don’t know if there's sharp rocks under the surface or just sand.
</p>

		<h2>How To Paddle
</h2>

		<p>As you get more into kayaking you’ll realize that there’s lots of ways to paddle the small boat. You might even discover a more suitable style for yourself. Every individual is different and it’s the same for kayaking. The easiest way is to hold the two sided paddle with one hand on each side of it. Push down to either left or right side at a ninety degree angle. The three strokes used are the forward, reverse, and sweep. Forward is the most common and is good to practice. Reverse is for going backwards, or some times can be used to rotate the boat. The sweep is generally used to move the entire kayak in a new direction. However all of these can be improved on over time and I would recommend finding a comfortable sitting position to help with balance. Other than that I hope to see you on the water.
