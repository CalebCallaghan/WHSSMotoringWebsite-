	<h1>For repairing yz 250/ general maintenance </h1>

	<p>Hi, today I’ll be working on a 2004 yz 250 2 stroke.</p>
	<p>First, we will have to remove all the plastics and remove the seat… after removing the seat we will need to check on the air filter. If it looks bad, I will attempt to clean it ,or if I can’t clean it, I would need a new air filter. After removing the seat i'll check over all the plastics for cracks or bends that shouldn be there if there are to many cracks or bends i will have to replace it, scratches are normal and can be very easy to remove so don't buy new plastics if it only has scratches. Then I would start taking apart the subframe... Three bolts to remove the subframe one at the top mid frame and 2 bolts down by the foot pegs.. After the subframe is removed from the main frame we will have to disconnect the carburetor from the air box… to do that their is a phillips head screw on the rubber boot holding it to the air box.. After getting that carburetor off i’ll remove the exhaust silencer from the pipe and keep it with the subframe for cleaning later.. Now make sure there isn't anything in the intake side of the carburetor… no dirt, sand , dust, mud, or any mice nests or rat nests. After you make sure its clean remove the carburetor from the cylinder, make sure your reeds are good and no cracks. After stuff a good rag into the reeds make sure not to leave it in when putting everything back together. Disconnect the throttle cable from the carburetor. Make sure NOTHING gets into the carburetor while it is off the bike. It can cause things to fly into the jets and clog them... If they are clogged the bike will not run or not run right.  </p>
