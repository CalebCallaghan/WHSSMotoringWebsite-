	<h1>Buying a used bike </h1>

	<p>Things to look out for when buying a used dirt bike, first step always bring someone with you. If you don't you might up just buying the bike because of excitement. Take time to go around the bike check for leaks, cracks in plastics or motor. check and see if there is any play in the swing arm, tri clamp, and wheels. If there is any play in the swing arm it will need bearings and or bushings.</p>

	<p>If the tri clamp moves side to side or can move up and down it will need bearings and bushings.</p>

	<p>If your rear wheel can wobble from side to side it will put unwanted wear on the chain and would be a good idea to replace the chain or sprocket followed with a new set of bearings. </p>

	<p>If the suspension is squishy and is springy you might have a blown shock which is pricey but it could also be set up for someone lighter. The forks should move a little bit when holding the break and pushing forward.. If they don't move at all they might be set up for someone a lot heavier or could have something blocking them from moving,and could possibly need a fork rebuild. </p>

	<p>Check the motor and see if the engine has been warmed up. If it is then it might have trouble starting and the person tried to hide it by starting it beforehand. </p>

	<p>If you can test it try going through the gears and listen for backfiring on a 4 stroke, backfiring could be a cause of blow by, valves out of adjustment, the carburetor could also be out of adjustment, if you see any white smoke with a sweet smell it has a head gasket leak and could blow up, if there smoke coming out with a bad smell its burning oil witch is okay for 2 stroke but not a 4 stroke. Check the brakes as well breaks can cost a bit if it is a race bike.</p>

	<p>Check the oil for metal and debris if there is alot there could be a big problem in the bottom end which will cost a lot of money, also a good idea to bring a compression tester anything under 100 psi is most likely done and would need a new top end or more. </p>
