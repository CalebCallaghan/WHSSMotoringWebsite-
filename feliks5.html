		<h1>Lamborghini Aventador</h1>

		<p>Lamborghini was founded by Ferruccio Lamborghini.  After the Second World War, he founded a business making tractors from reconfigured surplus military machines.  He was very successful and became very wealthy as he expanded into other areas of business.  With his success, he bought a Ferrari.  The Lamborghini car company was established in 1963 and its first car debuted the same year, the Lamborghini 350 GTV.</p>

		<p>In 2012, Lamborghini introduced the Lamborghini Aventador.  It has a 6.5-liter V12 engine and is rated a 690 hp.  After 5 years, 5000 Aventadors have been made.  It can do 0-60 in just 2.9 seconds.  The car was designed to improve performance with the aerodynamics of the car.  It has doors that lift up (scissor doors) instead of opening to the side like on a normal car.</p>

		<p>One of the good things about the Aventador is that is has one of the best aerodynamics.  The sportscar can brake very sharply, it can stop from 62 mph in 98 feet and 5 inches.  A good thing about the car is that it performs very well and gets lots of attention.</p>

		<p>A problem with the Lamborghini as a practical car is that it sits very low, so you can get stuck in some places.  Also, since the car is very expensive it can get damaged or stolen so using it as an everyday car is not very practical.  It also uses a special kind of fuel which can cost more and be available in less places.</p>

		<p>As a car for students, it is not recommended at all.  First of all, it is very expensive.  Expenses include gas, insurance, the car itself, and you risk using it every day if someone damages it.  The car will eat lots of fuel so you will spend lots of money on gas.</p>
