		<h1>Dodge Challenger</h1>

		<p>In July 1914, Dodge Motors was formed by the Dodge Brothers, Horace Dodge and John Dodge.  Their first year only 249 cars were produced.  The first car from them was named "Old Betsy".  Old Betsy was a five passenger car and it had a 25 HP, four cylinder L-head engine.  Both of the Dodge brothers died in 1920.  John Dodge died from pneumonia.</p>

		<p>The first ever car named Dodge Challenger came out in 1959 called Dodge Silver Challenger, but then there were no more Challengers.  Then in 1970, the Challenger came back and the first officially named first generation Dodge Challenger was released in 1970.  The first generation challenger was mainly for Canada and the US.  Right now, the current Challenger is in the 3rd generation which started in 2008 and is still the current generation.</p>

		<p>One of the good things about the Dodge Challenger is that it is very spacious inside, it provides a lot of room for the passengers.  Another good thing about it is that is has a smooth comfortable ride.  It also has a large trunk.  Also, another reason to consider this car is that it has a really powerful engine.</p>

		<p>The bad thing about the Dodge Challenger is that it is a heavy car and some models are not good on gas mileage.  Another thing is that it has poor rearward visibility due to the design of the rear window.</p>

		<p>As a car for students, I do not rate it as very good because some models have very poor gas mileage and the insurance can be more expensive because you can be more likely to crash it, as well as it classifies as a sports car (it is very powerful).  It is also not the cheapest car.</p>
