<h1>Driving A Boat And Tips</h1>

<h2>How Do You Drive A Boat?</h2>

  <p>Most people assume that driving a boat is the same as driving a car or land vehicle, but it's very different in many ways. First of all a boat is constantly moving as a result of tides and waves from the water. It also doesn’t have any breaks so stopping is a little more difficult if you haven’t ever driven one. Driving a boat is also the opposite of a car when your reaching higher speeds. In a car going faster makes it harder to control and increases the chance of losing control. However, in a boat, the faster you go the easier it is to steer and maneuver in the water making driving and boating opposites in that perspective. In general boating requires you to always be watching out for others, but as well as the forces of nature in this case being water and or the shore.</p>

  <h2>What Are Some Rules And Regulations On The Water?</h2>

  <p>While on the water there are many rules very boater must follow and comply too.
  The first rule you should remember when getting into the water is that certain areas are wake free. This means that you have to go very slowly in order to not create any small waves from your boat that could bother others. Certain areas near cottages or homes will be no wake areas as well so keep an eye out for a sign that says so. As well as being aware of what speed limits are on certain waterways and not to overstep them. When your driving your boat out in the water how do you know who your allowed to pass? Anybody on the left of ur boat has to give you the right away, anybody on your right has the right away. This rule applies to every boater and watercraft and is the same no matter where you are. Those are just some of the basics to help anyone who’s new to boating.</p>

  <h2>What Are Some Tips For Boating?</h2>

  <p>The first tip is to make sure that all your safety equipment is packed on the boat and you have food and water. Keeping all first aid items in reach helps if there’s an emergency and you need them immediately. Always remember to have your license on you while your out on the water. Your boat should always have enough life jackets for everyone on board and they should be wearing them when the boats moving. Drinking while boating is still illegal and can result in you losing both boating license and your drivers license. The fine for this is also about 600$ and if you continue to do this it will increase(Increasing and other laws depend by province or state.).  As well as you should always make a plan or tell a responsible person where you're going and who’s with you. This makes sure everyone gets home safely and if anything happens they know where to go looking for you.</p>
