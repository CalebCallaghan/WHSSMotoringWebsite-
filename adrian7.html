	<h1>Buying the proper gear part 2 </h1>

	<p>Getting a jersey. The jersey isn't used to protect you from anything really it's more like shirt. The shirt is more for matching the pants and completing the outfit. The jersey will fit like a shirt and shouldn be very tight but shouldn't be really loose. The jersey also helps with getting sunburnt. When I tried on the usual t-shirt size but that fit too tightly so i would suggest trying on a couple different sizes and see from their. The jersey should be longer than a normal shirt because the jersey would fit into your pants.I payed $23.85. Originally the shirt cost $44.95</p>

	<p>Getting pants. The pants do have padding in them and leather on the inside of your knee to keep the exhaust from touching your skin. The pants also can match with your jersey. You have to watch with the pants because they aren't like usually sizes and fitting. You have to keep in mind the knees can't be really tight because of the knee pads. The pants should be a little baggy but not that baggy. My pants cost $80.95. Originally the pants were $139.95</p>

	<p>Getting gloves. The gloves have a bit  of padding in them for if you fall off there's padding on the inside of your hand. There are finger grips for using the throttle to have better control. The gloves can also match with your jersey and pants. The gloves should be tight to your hands but not so tight that you can't move your fingers. The gloves shouldn't be bigger than your hand they should fit our hands perfectly. My gloves cost $19.95. Originally the gloves cost $32.95</p>

	<p>So far i have only spent $424.59 on most of my dirt bike gear. You may think that i got cheap gear but that's not true i just waiting for the tent sale to come to guelph and got most of my stuff there. I also got all my gear in fox. Which if you don't know is a well known name brand. </p>
