		<h1>How To Drive A Seadoo</h1>

		<h2>The Basics</h2>

		<p>Driving a PWC(Personal watercraft.) or seadoo can be difficult if you’ve never had any previous experience doing so. A few things you should remember is that not all of them have brakes. However it's not quite the same as braking with a car. The motor is equipped with a smart braking system that reverses the motor when you brake. It has failed before, so always be careful. PWC’s aren’t all the same, so always make sure your comfortable with whatever your driving.  Always remember to wear a life jacket when you’re out on the water, as well for any passengers you’re taking with you.</p>

		<h2>Turning
</h2>

		<p>When you’re driving a PWC you always have to have your hand on the gas for more than just to keep moving. A PWC only turns when your giving it gas, as well as the more speed you have the sharper the turn. When turning you should always be looking ahead to where you're going to be rather than where you are. This helps you see where other people are going to be in relation to when you turn. As well PWC’s are smaller and easier for someone in a big boat to miss so always be extra careful going around a bend or any sharp turn.</p>

		<h2>Wake
</h2>

		<p>While your driving a PWC you’ll encounter a lot of wake. You have to be very careful while your going overtop as you can flip the seadoo or fall off. When your looking out for wake look for large crests in the water or large boats. Larger vessels often create a lot of wake as they go. If you're not expecting it you could be knocked off. Most people enjoy driving over the wake because it’s exciting and thrilling. You can also get some serious air time if it's done properly. </p>
