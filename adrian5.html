	<h1>Full face vs half face helmet </h1>

	<p>Half faced helmets are usually worn for trial bike riding. These helmets cover the back of your head, the sides of your face, it also covers the top of your head and it has a little beak on the front. But these helmets don't have anything that covers your face which means if you fall off and hit your face you could potentially break something: you could break your jaw, and it doesn't protect your neck if your head lashes forward or back. These helmets are used for more visibility and your face doesn't sweat as much. The half faced helmets are lighter in weight. They are easier for your head to hold. The color variety is limited and the brands are limited. </p>

	<p>Full face helmets are used for dirt biking, motorcycles and ATVing. This helmet has more protection to your face. It covers your whole face, it protects your chin and your neck from bending too far. They fit better while you are wearing a neck brace. If you are going into motocross you have to have a full face helmet. Full face helmets have visors or a place to put your goggles. There is more technology in the full face helmets more higher tech padding. You have a lot more options with full face helmets like more sizes, more colors and more brands. This makes it more customizable and more personalized to you. You could make your gear all match according to something you like, for example, I like the brand Fox... I can get a Fox helmet that matches my gloves,  boots, jersey and pants. The full face helmets have a range in prices, some of the helmets may be more expensive but would you rather buy a more expensive helmet that protects your face completely or buy a cheap helmets and you break bones or end up dead. </p>
