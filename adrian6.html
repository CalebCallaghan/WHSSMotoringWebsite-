	<h1>Buying the proper gear part one</h1>

	<p>I went to the tent sale at royal distributing, during the tent sale there is no tax inside the store and inside the text everything is on sale. </p>
	<p>Getting a helmet, the helmet has to properly fit your face, when i got my helmet their was a lady there and she grabbed the nose piece on my helmet and told me to shake my head as much as I could, my head didn't move too much meaning the helmet fit my head. If i was wearing a helmet that was too big, I would be able to move my head a lot more. Another thing she asked me was if my helmet was squishing my head and giving me a headache, if the helmet is giving me a headache that means it's too small for you. If the helmet squishes your cheeks that's okay because the more you pull it on and off your head the helmet padding will adjust to your face. You also have to break in your helmet, meaning wearing the helmet around the house and taking it off and putting it back on. My helmet cost me $119.85 instead of normal price which is $169.95. </p>

	<p>Getting boots, the boot should not squeeze your feet. They should feel like shoes but a bit heavier . When i got my boots the lady asked me if my toes were touching the front of the boot and if my toes feel squished because if that was happening those boots were to small for me. You want your boots to feel comfortable because you will be wearing them a lot when riding. She also said that if they were a little bit squished that's okay okay because you have to break in the boots meaning they will fit better to your feet. When you get new boots your have to break them in, so wearing them around the house walking in them, running and bending in them making sure they move like their supposed to. My boots cost $179.99 these boots were inside so they  didn't have any tax. </p>
